# My First Website Blog

This project is a simple personal blog website that showcases my favorite activities, places to eat, and cultural experiences. The website is built using basic HTML and CSS, with a focus on structuring content and styling it for an engaging user experience.

## Features

- **Header & Navigation**: 
  - The header includes the blog's title and a navigation bar that links to different sections of the website, including the homepage, a blog post, and an about me page.

- **Main Content**:
  - The main content is divided into three sections:
    1. **Things to Do**: Highlights fun activities like Glow in the Dark Kayaking, with an image to accompany the text.
    2. **Places to Eat**: Recommends authentic dining experiences, featuring a vibrant food image.
    3. **Rich Culture**: Celebrates the rich culture of the location, with a focus on color, dance, and music.

- **Interactive Elements**:
  - Includes buttons for user interaction, such as a "Click Me!" button and a "Learn More" link button.

- **Footer**: 
  - The footer simply states "Personal Travel Blog 2024", marking the blog as a personal project for the year.

## Project Structure

- **HTML**: The main structure of the website is defined in `index.html`.
- **CSS**: The styling is handled by an external stylesheet located at `./css/main.css`.
- **Images**: The blog uses several images (`Kayak.jpg`, `food.jpg`, `Culture.jpg`) located in the `./images/` directory to visually enhance the content.
